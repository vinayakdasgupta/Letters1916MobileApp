### How It Works:

1.  **Geolocation Detection**:
    
    *   When the app is loaded, it automatically requests permission to access the user's location.
        
    *   If permission is granted, the app fetches the user's coordinates (longitude and latitude).
        
2.  **Data Retrieval**:
    
    *   The app fetches letter data from a local JSON file containing historical details and geographical coordinates for each letter.
        
3.  **Distance Calculation**:
    
    *   Using the Haversine formula, the app calculates the distance between the user's location and the location of each letter.
        
4.  **Display of Results**:
    
    *   The letters are sorted by distance, and the 10 closest letters are dynamically displayed in the app.
